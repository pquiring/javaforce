Jun 9/2015 : JF 9.0.0 released!
  - after spending years working with JNA I've decided to switch back to JNI.
    - JNA uses libffi which is too complex and VERY slow.
  - Native sound has been removed - don't notice a latency difference with Java sound anymore and it's just redundant
  - All Windows native code has been converted and tested
    - mingw headers have greatly improved since last time I used JNI (only 2 minor GUIDs missing)
    - jawt is used to get window handles for OpenGL support
    - removed jfRDP for now (I have a different plan)
  - All Linux native code has been converted and mostly tested (except the jfLinux related APIs)
    - OpenGL seems stable
    - jawt is used to get window handles for OpenGL support
    - WebCamera uses libv4l2 which will convert colorspaces to RGB
      - so all cameras should be supported now
    - deb packages now specify Architecture set to amd64 since the packages do include some native code
      - since Linux is free I'm not going to bother with i386 packages (objections?)
  - Mac native code only supports WebCamera and ffmpeg
    - OpenGL is not supported because Java 7's new AWT only allows for a CALayer
      - the NSOpenGLCALayer doesn't give full control over the OpenGLContext (when to swap, etc).
        - you can only use OpenGL in the drawInOpenGLContext callback
      - hence JOGL uses a GLAutoDrawable (it's automatic)
        - I'ved used JOGL before but found the API too complex (and too many jars/dlls)
      - some JavaForce OpenGL projects require full OpenGL control
      - only option is to use another toolkit such as SWT or LWJGL with TWL to support Macs
      - even Oracle is dumping AWT and creating JavaFX (which doesn't expose OpenGL yet)
    - WebCamera is not stable yet
  - with the new JNI library I'm already seeing better performance in many of the multi-media apps
  - fixed Javaforce's OpenGL GLSL code to work with Mesa3D (which doesn't support flat varying)
    - used a uniform shared between the vertex and fragment shaders instead
  - thanks to who ever is putting JavaForce on github.com - it's been real useful ;)
  - all generated MSI files will now show minial dialogs (licence agreement, installation completion, repair, etc.)
    - the common public license used seems acceptable
  - JFImage now supports saving *.icns files (Mac Icons)
    - see javaforce.utils.jimgconvert
  - jfdmg/1.0 released!
    - a new utility to generate Mac .dmg files
    - supports hciutil (mac only) or genisoimage (cygwin?/linux) to generate .dmg files
    - genisoimage creates 'uncompressed' .dmg files (jars are compressed anyways)
    - untested
  - jfEdit/0.9 released!

    - argument expanding is now implemented (globbing)
    - javaforce.jna.WinPE is used to patch the EXE for Windows
    - TODO : find a reliable way to attach properties to Linux executables
    - TODO : MacOSX (anyone want to donate a MacMini with Intel Core2 or better ;)
  - all MSI files are now split into 32bit and 64bit files for Windows
  - added some JNI functions in /native to complement JNA (see javaforce.jni.JFNative)
    - these functions are used just to call functions within OpenGL for greater performance
      - libffi (used by JNA) is a HUGE performance bottleneck
      - these new functions have DOUBLED the frame rate in jfCraft
    - if the JNI library fails to load it will fall back to JNA
    - overtime I plan to merge JNA into JF but using non-generic invoke...() functions
  - jfHex & jfHexBig
    - minor fixes
  - jfCraft/0.12 released!

  - jfCraft/0.6 released!
    - entities are now Blender models instead of hand coding them
      - hundred to thousands of lines of code removed
  - VoIP framework improvements
    - started to fix the CallDetails memory leak
      - freeing the CallDetails was never done before since I was not sure when to do it

      - they are small and was never a concern until someone said the autodialer was using a lot of memory

Sept 12/2013 : JF 6.15.0 released!
  - finished Linux APIs for Sound and Camera
    - LnxSound uses Alsa - latency seems about the same as Java
    - LnxCamera uses V4L2 - only a few pixel formats are supported (MJPEG, RGB32 and YUYV)
    - FFMPEG.Camera uses V4L2 via libavdevice but is NOT working yet.
      - I'm finding it hard just to get a working version of FFMPEG for linux.
  - fix : JFImage.saveJPG() now works in Linux without using native code.  OpenJDK does have an encoder but only supports BufferedImages
          of type TYPE_3BYTE_BGR, not TYPE_INT_*.  In fact the Windows JVM creates bad JPG images when using TYPE_INT_* images.
          So I create a BufferedImage of TYPE_3BYTE_BGR and copy the pixels over before saving the image.
          Now it works on Windows and Linux properly using the JVM.

    - a simple class that stores Objects in a global table.  Great for sharing data between JSP pages.
  - NEW : jedit has been split into two projects
    - jedit (multi-tabbed text editor)
    - jhex (multi-tabbed hex editor)
    - this makes things more managable and allows jedit to delete \r on load which are annoying characters
  - NEW : Bitmap has been merged into JFImage and now uses just BufferedImage
    - much faster than using int pixels[] and a MemoryImageSource (10x faster)
    - one note though, print() now prints on the baseline instead of the upper corner so you should add the baseline
      to the y coordinate.  baseline = int[1] from getFontMetrics()
  - NEW : 3D Completed
    - all 3D code (using OpenGL) is now completed
    - a new 3d map editor (/projects/mapeditor3d)
    - a new 3d game (/projects/game3d)
    - fixed many bugs in 3DS file loading and rendering (texture coordinates, animations, object parents, etc.)
    - NOTE : blender.org 3DS export doesn't work to good.  Use 3DSMax instead.

Apr 3/2009 : JF 3.8.3 released!
  - FIX : /projects/jfr was not handling \x## properly.

Feb 23/2009 : JF 3.8.2 released!
  - FIX : /javaforce/ParseArgs.java didn't handle zero-length arguments (ie: "")
    - fixes some minor tools (jfr)

Jan 5/2009 : JF 3.8.1 released!
  - NEW : updated /projects/crm, net2ftp, net2sftp:
    - used Content-Disposition to force filename of downloaded file (instead of always being named download.jsp).
    - used JavaScript to confirm delete action
    - used lots of JavaScript (aync loading) to cleanup the pages
  - FIX : crm was not converting web % codes when creating a new user's path

Oct 14/2008 : JF 3.8.0 released!
  - NEW : /examples/ex21 - java launcher
      This is just the simple C code to create a JVM and run a JAR/class.
  - NEW : /examples/ex22 - WinNT Service Java launcher
      This is a modified java launcher that includes code to make it a WinNT Service.
  - NEW : /projects/proxyservice
      This is a simple Proxy server that support GET/POST/CONNECT(443).
      It's a WinNT Service, is somewhat slow (some debugging is required), but works.
  - NOTE: These new examples/projects require cygwin/gcc installed.
  - FIX : /projects/jfterm - properly setup the sites tree when it's null

July 21/2008 : JF 3.7.0 released!
  - NEW : OpenGL implementation now supports glColor4() so that
    textures can have their RGBA values modified on the fly.
    This can allow objects to become transparent or alter their
    red/green/blue colors (like a filter) without having to modify
    the textures themselves.
    Each GLObject includes:
      float color[4];
    that represents RGBA, which by default is { 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f }
    Values can range from 0.0f to 1.0f.
    I had to enable GL_COLOR_MATERIAL which has also caused lighting
    factors to increase by 10x for some reason.
    Also renamed GLObjectGroup to GLModel and moved the 3DS loading
    functions to it.  May add other formats in the future.
  - NEW : /examples/ex20 - a native test
  - NEW : /projects/defrag - a Win32 native defrag app in Java
  - NEW : /projects/jedit
    - now includes a Hex edit mode (F5)
    - cleared undo history after loading a file, otherwise undo
      was emptying the TextArea as it was before the text was loaded.
  - FIX : numerous bug fixes

Mar 5/2008 : JF 3.6.0 released!
  - NEW : /projects/net2sftp - a web-based interface to sftp sites.
    Just like net2ftp.com except for sftp.
    Upload the WAR file to tomcat apache and you're good to go.
  - NEW : /projects/net2ftp - a web-based interface to ftp sites.
    Just like net2ftp.com.
    After completing net2sftp I figure this would be a good idea too.
  - NEW : /projects/cms (Content Management System)
    a web-based interface to manage your files on your webserver (tomcat).
    Now you can upload individual files instead of having to upload
    a whole WAR file for minor updates.
  - NOTE : net2sftp, net2ftp & cms include a Java upload feature that allows
    files to be uploaded in packets and is even proxy friendly.
    I've been able to upload 100+ MB files, that would otherwise
    not be possible.
  - NEW : GLScene.initFog() - added fog support to my OpenGL support.
    Used in glmaze2d/3d.
    Also fixed the texture coords in glmaze2d.
  - NEW : implemented jedit execute function (CTRL-E)
  - FIX : JFImage was fixed.
    Example#18 now mixes OpenGL with a semi-transparent Bitmap on top.
  - NOTE : I removed the bin2is util, since it's easier to just
    use ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream().

Jan 29/2008 : JF 3.5.0 released!
  - NEW : OpenGL support (JOGL) http://jogl.dev.java.net
    /examples/ex18 - OpenGL example (rotating transparent box)

    /projects/glmaze2d - OpenGL maze game (2D maps)
    /projects/glmaze3d - OpenGL maze game (3D maps)
    /projects/pngalpha - Tool to modify alpha level of PNG files.
    /docs/jogl.txt - Info on getting JOGL installed.  It's now
      required since many source files depend on it.
    The javaforce package has many new classes for OpenGL
    objects.  The Bitmap class also has some new functions
    and some renamed.
  - NEW : JFTextArea - a new class that extends JTextArea
    and adds overwrite mode and undo/redo (used in jedit)

    - little things I didn't know...
  - NEW : /projects/joggplayer
      - requires Fluendo Cortado, jCraft jOgg, jCraft jOrbis(Vorbis)
      - To make Cortado resizable after calling init() you need to
      remove getSize() function in com/fluendo/player/Cortado.java
      and any code that references appletDimension.
  - NEW : jedit now supports line wrap (see options F2)
  - FIX : another jfterm ANSI bug fixed (improved eol handling)

Nov 1/2007 : JF 3.3.2 released!
  - FIX : /projects/tts build.xml was not placing required class
      files in the right place.
  - FIX : cleaned up jfterm
    - before I was piping input data to the EDT (event
      dispatching thread) but that's not needed now that
      it's done in another thread.

Oct 30/2007 : JF 3.3.1 released!
  - FIX : jfterm latency issues have finally been fixed.
    - needed to call OutputStream.flush() after calling write()
    - also created another thread to handle rendering which has a lower
      priority.  Helps when displaying large content.
    - also fixed closing the tab properly when connection is lost

Oct 24/2007 : JF 3.3.0 released!
  - NEW : UnixCrypt - encrypt uni-direction passwords
    - see /src/javaforce/UnixCrypt.java

  - NEW : jfterm now supports scripting
    - see /projects/jfterm/readme.txt
  - NEW : JProcess and JProcessManager
    - allows multiple-processes in one JVM.
    - code based on echidna (old code)
    - problem : not too useful because you
      can't change the current path in the JVM
  - NEW : /projects/jtaskmgr
    - uses new JProcess* classes and a simple tray icon that
      can launch executable JAR files (requires Java SE 6)
      all within the same JVM (saves memory).
    - you can also launch apps via HTTP query
  - NEW : implemented save() in Bitmap class (using javax.imageio)

Sept 29/2007 : JF 3.1.1 released!

Sept 26/2007 : JF 3.1.0 released!
  - NEW : XML class now supports reading/writing to POJOs.
      XML.readClass(XMLTag parent, Object pojo);
        This will read the contents of the pojo and store
        it as children tags to the parent tag (creating
        children tags if needed).
      XML.writeClass(XMLTag parent, Object pojo);
        This will write the children of parent and store
        them in the pojo.
      Currently only supports : boolean, int, String and Color.
      This is being used by jedit and jfterm.
      Some field names have changed so you may want to delete your
      old setting files.

Sept 25/2007 : JF 3.0.2 released!
  - DEL : Removed the Random class from JavaForce.  Just use
    the one in java.util.  The only function I liked in there

    works with the standard Random class now.
    This resolves all name conflicts.
  - NEW : jedit now supports auto indent feature (Press F2 to configure).

Sept 19/2007 : JF 3.0.0 released!
  - NEW : all makefile's have been converted to build.xml (ANT) format.
      After getting frustrated with make I decided to learn ANT and I like it.
  - NEW : added /projects/mapeditor and /projects/game.
      It's a simple RPG I'm working on but not much works yet.
      It does show how Serialization can make working with data easy.
  - NEW : lots of additions to the JavaForce package.
      The Bitmap class now supports some alpha blend operations.

Aug 26/2007 : JF 2.3.3 released!
  - FIX : I tried to increase buffer sizes in jfterm in the
      last release but it caused a regression where telnet
      connections would stall.

Aug 24/2007 : JF 2.3.2 released!
  - FIX : lots of ANSI fixes in jfterm.

      includes a TreeModel.
  - FIX : numerous fixes thru out everything.
  - NFO : I watched the movie "the Number 23" while making this
    version.  Freaky...

May 29/2007 : JF 2.0.4 released!
  - NEW : the javaforce package now includes JFApplet and JFApp, to start
      building better java applets and apps.
    They include some classes for easy GUI control, and misc functions.
    Check out examples #11 that uses it.

  - NEW : added MySQL class to javaforce package
  - NEW : added MySQL example #14

Mar 5/2007 : JF 2.0.1 released!
  - FIX : MsgClient doesn't use SwingUtilities.invokeLater() anymore and calls the callback
    directly.  You can now use invokeLater() yourself or do non-swing processing in your
    callback function.
  - NEW : Example #11 - a swing applet.
  - NOTE : I've successfully created a swing applet that connects to an C++ database server,
    pulls up data and makes changes.  Because the applet runs thru a webbrowser, there is no
    need to redistribute updates to the clients.
    My C++ client required a network share connection but WinXP Home Edition has a limit
    on the # of network connections (which is where they are running the server) - so using
    an applet to interface databases is a great alternative.
    My Server is written in C++ using DigiForce's MsgServer class, and the applet uses the
    MsgClient to send/receive messages.

Mar 1/2007 : JF 2.0 released!
  - NEW : Added some new examples
    - ex9 - a swing application
    - ex10 - a messaging example that is compatible with Example #15 of DigiForce SDK.

Feb 24/2007 : JF revived!
  - NEW : Started to implement a web server and the old telnet server in 100% Java code.
    This will eliminate all C++ code.  I'm also switching to traditional makefile's
    so the DigiForce(C++) SDK will no longer be needed.
    The makefile's use javac command line tool (from Sun's JDK) to compile.

Apr 19/2006 : JF 1.0.1 released!
  - FIX : hide cursor function was ignored
  - FIX : version is now reported properly (was still 092).  Now reports 101 (100 was skipped ;).
  - FIX : updatescreen function was ignored
  - NEW : Added jWindow sample (uses new jWindow class from DigiForce SDK/3.0.4)

Mar 21/2006 : JF 1.0.0 released!

Nov 26/2005 : init release - JF 0.0.1 released!
  - jView Telnet Client (Java Applet) only support ANSI/Telnet functionality.
  - TelnetServer(C++) created (requires DigiForce SDK)
  - sample module just echos back input
