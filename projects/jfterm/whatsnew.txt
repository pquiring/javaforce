          Used to save/restore cursor position which I found is in use at pharcyde.org

Jan 26/2014 - jfTerm/0.10 released!
  - fixed finding a proper monospaced font (which varies per OS)
    - see javaforce.JF.getMonospacedFont()
    - still need to adjust font metrics though (not sure why) but the defaults should be more accurate

Jan 18/2014 - jfTerm/0.9 released!
  - added support for Com Ports (uses JNA : Windows/Linux only)
  - added support for ASCII 8bit chars (use a lookup table to convert to Unicode chars)
    - can view sites with cool ASCII art
    - note:sometimes the font metrics calc is not perfect so I added some font size adjustments in the settings.
  - use JNA to use pty on linux (binary program openpty is no longer needed)

Nov 8/2013 - jfTerm/0.8 released!
  - fixed painting parts of screen (offset was missing)
  - speed up scrolling when using mouse wheel
  - undo a change in 0.7 that caused top line to be slightly offscreen
    - it's properly fixed now so top and bottom lines fit on screen

Oct 26/2013 - jfTerm/0.7 released!
  - fixed 100% CPU usage on linux
    - paintComponent() in Buffer.java draws each char to the Graphics object which is very slow on Linux
      so I draw to an image and then drawImage() on the Graphics object.
      Before the paintComponent() was taking 200-400ms, now it's 20ms
  - fixed a few other minor bugs
