jfRecord Desktop
================

Records your desktop to a video file.

You can include the mouse pointer if desired.

To stop/pause recording a tray icon will popup.

When you press Start and select a file to save to, the Window will hide and record until you stop it.

Note : This first time you run the program it may download a codecpack to create the video file.
