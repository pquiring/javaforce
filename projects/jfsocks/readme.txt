Includes a sample client that redirects a local port thru the SOCKS server to a remote host/port.
Great for connecting to insecure services behind a firewall (such as RDP).

Supports:
 - IP4
 - domain names
 - Secure SSL
 - SOCKS5 auth type 0x02 only (plain text:therefore use secure mode if using authentication)
 - allowed IP networks/IP addresses list
 - forward non-socks related local ports to another IP:port
 - forward remote ports on another SOCKS server

Notes:
 - if using socks5 authentication you should disable socks4 which doesn't require authorization.
