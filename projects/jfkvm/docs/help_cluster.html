Cluster:
========

In order to migrate guests you must connect your hosts into clusters.

First you need to generate keys on each host.

Then generate a token on each host that is used to connect to each host.

Next from each host copy the token and paste it into each other host and specify the hosts IP and click on Connect.

Now you are ready to migrate guests between hosts.

Host Types:

  On Premise = Local hosts for VM management such as migration and clustered storage.

  Remote = Remote hosts are used for VM backups and do not participate in storage clusters.
