Installing jfKVM:
=================

Requirements:
-------------
  Server with two NICs and two storage disks.
    Two network cards:
      - one for management interface (web based)
      - one for virtual machines and server virtual network interfaces
    Two storage disks:
      - one for linux distro (recommend Debian)
      - another for local storage pool
  Distros: Debian, Fedora or Arch.
    - only Debian is tested

Installation:
-------------

Install a server based Linux distro then run these commands as root:
  wget http://pquiring.github.io/javaforce/linux/install.sh
  chmod +x install.sh
  ./install.sh --desktop=no
Install jfkvm using distro package tool:
  apt install jfkvm
  systemctl enable jfkvm
  systemctl start jfkvm

Point your favorite browser to your server IP and get started.
First you'll need to create your admin password and then login.

Basic Settings:
---------------
  Click on Host : Settings
  Fill in FQN and IQN and click Save.
  The FQN is important for VNC to work later (you can use server IP address).

Virtual Switch:
---------------
  Now you'll need to create a virtual switch (or bridge) under Network : Virtual Switches.
  Note that if an existing 'br' type switch is present you should delete it and create an 'os' type switch (openvswitch).
  The bridge iface should be your second network card that will be used by the virtual machines.

Networks:
---------
  Next create Network VLANs that virtual machines will use under Network : Networks.

Storage:
--------
  Next you should partition your second disk using fdisk, create a large parition in ext4 format.
    fdisk /dev/sdb
    mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1
  Under Storage click on Add, select Local Partition type and enter the partition you just created.
  NFS and iSCSI are also available but untested at this time.
  Creating Storage pools using folders is NOT supported.

Now you are ready to create or import Virtual Machines!
