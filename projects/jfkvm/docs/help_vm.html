Virtual Machines:
=================

Before creating a virtual machine you need to upload iso files.
Install ssh on your server (depends on distro type).
Enable root access to ssh:
  vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    PermitRootLogin yes
  systemctl restart sshd
Use filezilla and connect to server over SFTP using root account.
Navigate to /volumes to find your storage pools and select a pool to store iso files.
Create a folder called 'iso' in this storage pool and upload iso files there.

To create a virtual machine click on Virtual Machines : Create

Type in a name and select a storage pool.
Then fill out the hardware options.
Create disk, set boot order = 1.
Add disk, navigate to where you uploaded your iso files and select one and set boot order = 2.
Save.

Now you can start the VM and click on 'Console' to interact with Virtual Machine.

After installation you should shutdown the VM, edit it and remove the iso disk.

Devices:
--------

You can add Network cards, Host devices and Controllers.
Controllers are usually added as needed so you should not need to add them
unless you need a specific model.
The Address within the guest VM can be specified.
libvirt format:domain.slot.bus.func
lspci format:bus.slot.func  (domain is implied to be zero)
Note the bus/slot are backwards.
