12-24-2013 : v0.14 released
 - new : added WebRTC conferencing (basically just copied apprtc.appspot.com - swapped out AppEngine Channel for WebSockets)
   - simple conferencing rooms for two guests each
   - the built in web service just transfers the SDP offers between guests using WebSockets, the PBX doesn't do any real "sip" work yet
   - hope to expand on support to have Web based phones that register and make calls, etc.
     - this would require implementing STUN/TURN service, DTLS channels, etc. (not an easy task)
   - only Firefox seems to work ('experimental') - the WebRTC standard is still not finalized yet

 - new : relay options : relayAudio/relayVideo to specify if PBX will relay audio/video streams (default = enabled)
 - new : option : MusicOnHold can now load a wav file which is played to anyone on hold (if relayAudio is enabled)
   - to select a wav file goto Message page, upload a wav file and then select it from General Settings.
   - wav file must be 8000Hz, 16bit, mono PCM format as usual.
 - fixed/implemented Messages delete and rename functions
 - fixed blind transfer (non-blind still not implemented yet)

11-28-2013 : v0.10 released

9-17-2013 : v0.9 released
 - new : use embedded Derby database server instead of MySQL
 - new : use embedded web-server that listens on port 8001 to configure server instead of JavaEE (tomcat)
   - with both database and web-server built-in there are no external dependancies anymore (and it's 100% Java).
