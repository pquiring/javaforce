jfRDP Server/Client
===================

jfRDP is a Remote Desktop Server/Client for Windows Vista and higher.
It uses the Windows Desktop Sharing API (the same that is used in Remote Assistance).

The server is setup with two passwords.
A web password that the client uses to download connection details.
A RDP password that allows the client to connect to the RDP session.

The server needs to generate an SSL certificate for the embedded webserver.
Click on the "Generate SSL Certificate" button once to create it.
Then set your passwords and your server is ready.
You can also allow multiple users to connect in viewonly mode (broadcasting).

To have the server start when you login place the server shortcut in your Startup folder.
