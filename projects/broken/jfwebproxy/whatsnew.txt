7-9-2015 : v1.5.0
  - added support for PHP
  - the redir scripts now pass the returned headers in the message content instead of trying to override them.
8-15-2014 : v1.4.2
  - doc fixes
8-4-2014 : v1.4.1
  - opps, used a null pointer that generated NPE if "Save and Restart" was clicked.
8-3-2014 : v1.4
  - the proxy server now generates fake SSL certificates for each secure site the webserver connects to so you no longer
    have to create overrides to connect to them.  You just need to add GAEProxy's root certifiate to your system.
    When the server is running open ~/.jgaeproxy/localhost.crt (%UserProfile%\.jgaeproxy\localhost.crt on Windows)
    and then all secure sites will seem properly signed (see readme.txt)
7-25-2014 : v1.3
  - added MSI package
  - removed the applet version (which was not very secure)
9-23-2013 : v1.2
  - fix a 100% CPU usage bug
8-27-2013 : v1.1
  - Can now handle files > 32MB by using Range HTTP header.  youtube works now thru proxy.  Not all sites support Range header.
  - Connections can ALL by made thru HTTPS to GAE to make your requests more private.  Use -secure on App version (not available in applet version)
