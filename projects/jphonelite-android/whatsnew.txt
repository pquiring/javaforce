8-3-2010 : jphonelite/0.17 BETA - Android Release #3
  - fix : number picker Dialog is deleted after each use (before the items in Dialog were always the first shown)
  - fix : used a seperate thread to read from MIC which greatly improved sound quality
          Sound.process() runs on a fixed 20ms timer and AudioRecord.read() blocks when waiting for the next chuck of data
            from the low-level recording process.  This would cause Sound.process() to block for a long period intermittently and then
            fire off in multiple recessions trying to keep up with all the timer events that occured during the block.
  - issue : last known problem is that I can't disable speaker mode on my phone
8-2-2010 : jphonelite/0.17 BETA - Android Release #2
  - fix : lines 2-6 were always using line 1 credentials
  - fix : MD5 qop=auth is now properly supported (qop=auth-int is not supported)
  - issue : AudioRecord.read() is sometimes blocking for 200-400ms.
