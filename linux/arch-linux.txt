Arch installation
-----------------
Arch Linux has a very simple installation guide or a script to automate the task which I recommend using.
The installation script will throw an exception unless you prep the keyring.
To install from the script run these commands:
  pacman-key --init
  pacman-key --populate archlinux
  archinstall
Within the install program make sure to select destination drive, drive partitioning, select minimal profile, set root password,
create user and setup networking manually.
